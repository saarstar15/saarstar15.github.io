    <h1>St. Paul's Hospital Foundation:<br>Together Fund Program</h1>

<div class="bkg_textbox">
    <p>Background:<br><br>St. Paul’s Hospital Foundation’s mission is to provide St. Paul’s Hospital with the funding needed to remain at the forefront of innovative patient care, medical research, and education. In order to remain competitive in the nonprofit sector, the Foundation hosts a variety of annual campaigns such as Lights of Hope, and Brilliant to raise funds.</p>

<h1>Problem:</h1>
<p>Working in contact with St. Paul’s Hospital Foundation, I was challenged with creating a brand to represent their new peer to peer giving program. This program's objectives were to strengthen their level 1 donor base and introduce the concept of social fundraising to current donors and young adults living in communities around the hospital. Additionally it was required that the identity remained unified with the St. Paul’s Hospital brand, yet not interfere with existing seasonal fundraising campaigns.
</p>
<h1>Solution:</h1>
<p>I created the Together Fund brand to represent an outlet for compassionate people to boost their generosity by rallying their friends to donate to a great cause and help bring their community together. The name and tagline became a direct translation of that idea; to communicate we can achieve more united as a network of givers, lead by a shared vision of helping others.<br><br>An encouraging personality and playful, yet adaptable visual style encourages viewers to explore their potential to express themselves and inspire giving. While an energizing colour scheme serves to distinguish the program from competitive offerings, and maintain ties to the St. Paul’s Foundation brand. The core messaging and photographic style was conceived to clearly communicate the concept of the program, breaking barriers of audience doubt.<br><br>To embody the power of this giving community, a name, visual identity, microsite, email template, social media strategy and magazine advertisement were created.
</p>
<h1>Results:</h1>
<p>Delivering Together Fund was a fantastic experience not only because we dealt with a real client, but also worked with a not-for-profit brand that forced me to carefully construct messaging that would inspire giving rather than purchasing. Fellow students, our client representative and my instructor agreed the messaging was well thought out and effectively communicated the peer to peer concept; that if implemented, would serve St. Paul’s Hospital Foundation well.
